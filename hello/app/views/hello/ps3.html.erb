</div>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  The offline alternatives to developing a project are rarely seen nowadays. Techniques like timing a programming session manually uing stop watch and using phone to communicate with teammates is rather too old now.
  Assigning tasks and managing a project offline is tough especially with regards to communication with teammates and individual workflow productivity.
  Therefore, to overcome these problems, an online platform to manage the project and it's team and using online timers and schedules to track progress and activity is a better alternative.

    community. Also write down anything strikingly good or bad about the registration process and the
    mechanisms of collaboration, e.g., in discussion forums, comments on articles, and chat rooms. Look
    for voice and mobile interfaces. If present, try them out. Look for evidence of personalization and

</div>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  The best existing online alternatives to project management are Github, Gitlab, Kanbanchi.
  These platforms are well known and have a good user base. They closely conform to the six elements of sustainability.
  The magnet content for the platforms describe the implementation of best practices of project management and attract users with the key element of productivity.
  These platforms also let users collaborate on the projects they are a part of.
  Searching and browsing capabilities are standard which provide filters to sort by date, name, etc.
  Although Kanbanchi does not have a delegated moderation as it considers a project team work, Github and Gitlab provide users with authority over some actions.
  Although Github and Gitlab feature a place to raise issues related to the project, the means of extending the community is limited.
  Personalization is also very limited in these platforms.

    your site at a more permanent home. Please include a plan for how you will do this. Note that AIT,
